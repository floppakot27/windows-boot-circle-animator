This Haxe program animates the Windows animation circle that you see when you bootup your computer with Windows in it.
The reason I am actually able to do this is because Microsoft uses a font for the actual animation. You can find it in assets/data/segoe_slboot.ttf
I just made this because I was bored. Might make this some sort of fake updater.
